# Summarize the project and what problem is was solving
For my portfolio, I decided to choose our first project, which focused on the company called Chada Tech and this company wanted their clients to view both a 12 and 24 hour clock on their website, rather than the simple 12 hour clock. For this first project, we were asked to apply a program logic that creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code. I then made an application/code that OOP and also designed a flowchart that helped guide me through the sequence of functions I provided. 

# What did I do particularly well?
To be completely honest, I did have a difficult time with this project, as certain files were incorrect and I still was having a hard time correcting them again. Certain items within the code I believe I did do ok with, and the flow chart I created outside of the project I believe I did well on. 

# Where could I enhance my code?
I could enhance the code I proposed within so many areas. As this class was a bit difficult for me, I am still earning how to properly word items and include comments correctly as they don't interfere with the code. 

# Did I find any part of this project challenging & what resources can I use to add to my support network?
First and foremost, Yes, I did find most of this project challenging, including other assignments and projects as well. As I did mention, I know I need a lot more practice with coding and programming languages. Everything is quite unique and I've enjoyed learning about it all. As for my support network, I will need to reach out more with tutoring and any assistance I can get as these courses are a bit challenging for me. 

# What skills from this project will be transferrable to other projects or courses?
I think a skill to take along from this project would be OOP, understanding the important principles which are abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, and also understanding how you can apply it to a secure C++ code.
